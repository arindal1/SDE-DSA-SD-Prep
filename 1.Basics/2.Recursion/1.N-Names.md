# Recursive Function to Print a Name `n` Times

## 🧾 Problem Statement

> **Goal:**
> Create a recursive function that prints the word `"name"` exactly **`n`** times, where `n` is a positive integer input.

---

## 📦 Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printName(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return;  // Base case: nothing to print
    }

    cout << "name" << '\n';  // Print and move to next line
    printName(n - 1);        // Recurse with n-1
}

int main() {
    int times = 5;
    printName(times); // Will print "name" 5 times
    return 0;
}
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### ✅ Recursion

* A technique where a function **calls itself**.
* Every recursive function needs:

  * A **base case** to stop the recursion.
  * A **recursive call** that reduces the problem size.

### ✅ Base Case

```cpp
if (n <= 0) return;
```

* Stops the recursion when `n` becomes zero or negative.
* Prevents **infinite recursion**.

### ✅ Recursive Call

```cpp
printName(n - 1);
```

* Each call reduces `n` by 1.
* Eventually hits the base case.

## 🧮 Dry Run Example

Let’s assume `n = 3`:

| Call Stack     | Output    |
| -------------- | --------- |
| `printName(3)` | `"name"`  |
| `printName(2)` | `"name"`  |
| `printName(1)` | `"name"`  |
| `printName(0)` | *(stops)* |

So, total output:

```
name
name
name
```

## 🔁 Algorithm

1. **Input**: Integer `n`.
2. **Check**: If `n <= 0`, return.
3. **Print**: `"name"`.
4. **Recur**: Call the same function with `n-1`.

---

## 📌 Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Function Entry

* Takes input `n`.
* If `n` is `0` or negative → do nothing and return.

### Step 2: Work (Print)

* Prints the string `"name"`.

### Step 3: Recursive Reduction

* Decreases the count `n` by 1.
* Calls itself again with the updated count.

## 💻 Output

For `n = 5`, the output will be:

```
name
name
name
name
name
```

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

| Metric              | Value                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 🕒 Time Complexity  | `O(n)`                     |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)` (due to call stack) |

Each recursive call is stored in the **call stack** until the base case is reached.

---

## 📎 Notes & Enhancements

* ✅ **Tail Recursion**: This function is *tail recursive* because the recursive call is the **last operation** in the function.
* ⚠️ Ensure that the input `n` is not negative. If needed, sanitize input in `main()` or before calling the function.
* ❗ No loop is used—this is purely recursive.
* 🧪 Easy to convert this logic to print other strings or perform similar repeated tasks.

---

## 📘 Summary

* This function is a textbook example of **recursion with a base case**.
* It demonstrates how recursion can replace loops in simple repeatable tasks.
* Ideal for educational purposes to teach recursion, base cases, and the stack.
