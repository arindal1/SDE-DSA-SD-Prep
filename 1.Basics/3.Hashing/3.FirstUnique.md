# üîç Find First Unique Character in a String (Using Hashing)

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, **return the index of the first non-repeating (unique) character**. If no such character exists, return `-1`.

> A character is considered unique if it appears exactly once in the entire string.

---

## üßæ Example

```cpp
Input:  s = "abbsba"
Output: -1
Explanation: Every character in the string appears more than once.

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation: 'l' is the first non-repeating character.
```

## üí° Approach & Intuition

This is a classic **hashing + linear scan** problem.

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. **Count Frequencies**:

   * Traverse the string and use a hash map to count how many times each character appears.
2. **Find First Unique**:

   * Traverse the string again, and check each character's frequency in the map.
   * The first character with a frequency of `1` is our answer.

> Why not just use one loop?
> Because we need to preserve the order of characters to find the **first** unique one, so a second loop is necessary.

## üîÅ Algorithm

```text
FUNCTION firstUniqChar(s):
    freq_map ‚Üê empty map<char, int>

    // 1. Count frequencies
    FOR each character c in s:
        freq_map[c]++

    // 2. Find first unique
    FOR i from 0 to length of s:
        IF freq_map[s[i]] == 1:
            RETURN i

    RETURN -1  // if no unique character found
```

---

## üíª C++ Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int firstUniqChar(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> mpp;

    // Step 1: Count frequencies of each character
    for (char c : s)
        mpp[c]++;

    // Step 2: Find the first character with frequency 1
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if (mpp[s[i]] == 1)
            return i;
    }

    // No unique character found
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abbsba";
    cout << firstUniqChar(s);
    return 0;
}
```

## üßÆ Time & Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Time       | **O(n)**                |
| Space      | **O(1)** (26 chars max) |

* `n` = length of the string
* Even though an `unordered_map` is used, there are at most **26 lowercase English letters**, so space usage is constant in practice.

---

## üß† Notes & Enhancements

* The code works for **lowercase letters**, but to support **mixed case**, or **Unicode**, modify the frequency map accordingly.
* You can replace `unordered_map<char, int>` with a fixed-size `int freq[26]` if only lowercase letters are used (faster and more memory efficient).
* Useful in problems involving **data streams**, **logs**, or **real-time uniqueness detection**.

## üß™ Test Cases

| Input        | Output | Explanation                                |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `"leetcode"` | `0`    | `'l'` is the first non-repeating. |
| `"aabb"`     | `-1`   | No unique character                        |
| `"racecar"`  | `3`    | `'e'` appears only once at index 3         |
| `""`         | `-1`   | Empty string                               |
