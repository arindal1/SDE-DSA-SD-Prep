# 🌳 Inorder Traversal using Morris Traversal (O(1) Space) [Leetcode #[94](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)]

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return its **inorder traversal**.

### Inorder Traversal Order

```
Left → Root → Right
```

But with a twist:

> You are **not allowed to use recursion or stack**
> Only **O(1) extra space**



## 🧠 Why this problem is special

This problem tests:

* Deep understanding of tree structure
* Pointer manipulation
* Space optimization
* Threaded binary trees concept

This is not just a traversal.
This is **pointer wizardry** 🪄🌳



## 👀 Example

### Tree

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /
    4
```

### Inorder Output

```
[4, 2, 1, 3]
```



## 🧩 Core Intuition (THIS is the key 🔑)

Normally, inorder needs:

* Recursion stack
* Or explicit stack

But Morris says:

> “Why not use the tree itself as the stack?” 😈

### Idea:

For every node:

* If it has a left child
* Find its **inorder predecessor**
* Make a temporary link (thread)
* Use that link to come back later

This avoids using any extra memory.



# 🐌 Brute Force Approaches

## 1️⃣ Recursive

```cpp
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    print(root);
    inorder(root->right);
}
```

Space: **O(H)** (call stack)



## 2️⃣ Iterative with Stack

```cpp
stack<TreeNode*> st;
```

Space: **O(H)**



# ✅ Optimal Approach (Morris Traversal)

### 🔥 Key Insight

We create **temporary right pointers** (threads) to simulate backtracking.

No recursion
No stack
No extra memory

Just pure pointer manipulation.



## ✅ Code  Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> inorder;
        TreeNode* cur = root;

        while (cur != NULL) {
            if (cur->left == NULL) {
                inorder.push_back(cur->val);
                cur = cur->right;
            } else {
                TreeNode* prev = cur->left;

                while (prev->right && prev->right != cur) {
                    prev = prev->right;
                }
                
                if (prev->right == NULL) {
                    prev->right = cur;     // create thread
                    cur = cur->left;
                } else {
                    prev->right = NULL;   // remove thread
                    inorder.push_back(cur->val);
                    cur = cur->right;
                }
            }
        }
        return inorder;
    }
};
```



## 🧠 Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

### For current node `cur`:

### Case 1: No left child

```
Visit cur
Move to cur->right
```



### Case 2: Has left child

Find predecessor:

```
prev = rightmost node in left subtree
```

#### If thread not created:

```
prev->right = cur
cur = cur->left
```

#### If thread already exists:

```
Remove thread
Visit cur
cur = cur->right
```



## 🔑 Why this works

* Every edge is visited at most **twice**
* Temporary links allow backtracking
* Tree structure is restored at the end

This is basically **inorder with time travel** 🕰️🌳



## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

| Metric           | Value    |
| - | -- |
| Time Complexity  | **O(N)** |
| Space Complexity | **O(1)** |

No stack.
No recursion.
Just raw pointer magic.



## 🧪 Test Cases

| Tree         | Output           |
| - | - |
| Empty        | []               |
| Single node  | [node]           |
| Balanced     | Correct inorder  |
| Left skewed  | Ascending        |
| Right skewed | Same as original |



## 🧠 Key Observations

* Tree is modified temporarily
* Always restored at the end
* No memory overhead
* Hard to think, easy to run



# 🚀 Variations (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 1️⃣ Morris Preorder Traversal

Just move the `push_back` earlier.

### 2️⃣ Morris Postorder Traversal

Harder, but possible.

### 3️⃣ Threaded Binary Trees

This is the underlying concept.




# ❓ FAQs

### Q1: Is Morris traversal safe?

Yes, tree is restored perfectly.



### Q2: Why isn’t this used everywhere?

Because it’s harder to implement and debug.



### Q3: Is this asked in interviews?

Yes — **for strong candidates only** 💀



### Q4: Does it work for all trees?

Yes ✔️ Any binary tree.



### Q5: Should I always use this?

No. Use when **space is constrained**.
