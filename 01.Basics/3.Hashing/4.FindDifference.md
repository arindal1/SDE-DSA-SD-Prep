# 🔍 Find the Extra Character in Two Strings



## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, where `t` is generated by **shuffling `s` and adding one extra character**, find and return that extra character.

---

### 🧾 Example

```cpp
Input:
s = "apple"
t = "atpple"

Output:
't'

Explanation:
All characters in `s` are in `t`.
```

---

## 💡 Approach & Intuition

This is a classic **frequency counting** problem, and we can use **hashing** to solve it efficiently.

We know:

* `t` contains all characters from `s` plus **one additional character**.
* We need to detect **which character has an odd frequency** after considering both `s` and `t`.

---

### ✅ Steps:

1. **Use a hash map** to count the frequency of characters from both `s` and `t`.
2. Characters that appear in both `s` and `t` will have **even frequency**.
3. The extra character (from `t`) will make its frequency **odd**.
4. Return the character with **odd frequency**.

## 🔁 Algorithm

```text
FUNCTION findTheDifference(s, t):
    Initialize empty map<char, int> freq_map

    FOR char c in s:
        Increment freq_map[c]

    FOR char c in t:
        Increment freq_map[c]

    FOR each entry (char, count) in freq_map:
        IF count is odd:
            RETURN char

    RETURN 'a'  // Default return, though logic ensures this line shouldn't be hit
```

---

## 💻 C++ Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    unordered_map<char, int> mpp;

    // Count frequency of each character in s
    for (char c : s)
        mpp[c]++;

    // Count frequency of each character in t
    for (char c : t)
        mpp[c]++;

    // Find the character with an odd frequency
    for (auto i : mpp) {
        if (i.second % 2 != 0)
            return i.first;
    }

    // This line is never expected to run
    return 'a';
}

int main() {
    string s = "apple";
    string t = "atpple";

    cout << findTheDifference(s, t);  // Output: t
    return 0;
}
```

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Time**   | O(n)                           |
| **Space**  | O(1) (bounded by charset size) |

* `n` is the length of the strings.
* Since we're dealing with characters, the space remains constant (`O(26)` for lowercase, `O(256)` for extended ASCII).

---

## 🧠 Additional Notes

* You can improve this by using XOR trick (bit manipulation), where `a^a = 0`, and `0^x = x`. XORing all characters of `s` and `t` gives the extra character directly in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.

  ```cpp
  char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
      char res = 0;
      for (char c : s) res ^= c;
      for (char c : t) res ^= c;
      return res;
  }
  ```

* The hashing approach is clearer and helps build fundamental understanding for similar problems.

## 🧪 Sample Test Cases

| `s`       | `t`        | Output |
| --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| `"apple"` | `"atpple"` | `'a'`  |
| `"abcd"`  | `"abcde"`  | `'e'`  |
| `"hello"` | `"lehloz"` | `'z'`  |
