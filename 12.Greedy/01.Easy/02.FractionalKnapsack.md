# 🎒 Fractional Knapsack [[TuF](https://takeuforward.org/plus/dsa/problems/fractional-knapsack)]


## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given:

* A knapsack with capacity `W`
* `n` items, each having:

  * `value`
  * `weight`

📌 **Rules:**

* You **can take fractions** of items (unlike 0/1 Knapsack).
* Goal is to **maximize total value** inside the knapsack without exceeding capacity.

🎯 **Return:**
The **maximum achievable value**.


## 🧠 Intuition

Since fractional items are allowed, the strategy is simple and greedy:

> Always take the item with the **maximum value per unit weight** first.

Why?

* If you have limited capacity, you want the *most value per kg*.
* This greedy choice is **provably optimal** when fractions are allowed.

Think of it like shopping with limited money:

* You buy the items that give you the **best deal per rupee** first 🛒


## 🪜 Brute Force (Not Needed)

Trying all combinations is unnecessary because:

* Fractional knapsack has **optimal substructure**
* Greedy choice property holds

So brute force or DP is overkill.


## 🚀 Optimal Greedy Approach

### Strategy

1. Compute `value / weight` ratio for each item.
2. Sort items in **descending order of this ratio**.
3. Start filling the knapsack:

   * If the entire item fits → take it fully.
   * Otherwise → take only the fraction that fits and stop.


## ✅ Clean Final Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Item {
    int value;
    int weight;
};

class Solution {
public:
    static bool comp(Item a, Item b) {
        double r1 = (double)a.value / a.weight;
        double r2 = (double)b.value / b.weight;
        return r1 > r2;
    }

    double fractionKnap(int W, Item arr[], int n) {
        sort(arr, arr + n, comp);

        int curWeight = 0;
        double finalValue = 0.0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (curWeight + arr[i].weight <= W) {
                curWeight += arr[i].weight;
                finalValue += arr[i].value;
            } else {
                int remain = W - curWeight;
                finalValue += ((double)arr[i].value / arr[i].weight) * remain;
                break;
            }
        }

        return finalValue;
    }
};

int main() {
    int n = 3, weight = 50;
    Item arr[n] = {{100,20},{60,10},{120,30}};
    Solution obj;

    double ans = obj.fractionKnap(weight, arr, n);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    cout << "The maximum value is: " << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}
```


## 🧩 Code Walkthrough

### 1️⃣ Value-to-Weight Ratio Comparator

```cpp
static bool comp(Item a, Item b) {
    return (double)a.value / a.weight > (double)b.value / b.weight;
}
```

Sort items so that:

* Best value-per-weight comes first.


### 2️⃣ Sorting Items

```cpp
sort(arr, arr + n, comp);
```

Now items are ordered from **best deal → worst deal**.


### 3️⃣ Filling the Knapsack

```cpp
if (curWeight + arr[i].weight <= W) {
    curWeight += arr[i].weight;
    finalValue += arr[i].value;
}
```

Take the full item if it fits.


### 4️⃣ Taking a Fraction

```cpp
int remain = W - curWeight;
finalValue += (arr[i].value / (double)arr[i].weight) * remain;
break;
```

* Take only the fraction that fits.
* Stop — knapsack is full.


## 🧪 Example Dry Run

### Input

```cpp
Items = {(100,20), (60,10), (120,30)}
W = 50
```

### Step 1: Compute ratios

| Item | Value | Weight | Ratio |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| A    | 60    | 10     | 6.0   |
| B    | 100   | 20     | 5.0   |
| C    | 120   | 30     | 4.0   |

Sorted order: **A → B → C**


### Step 2: Fill Knapsack

* Take A fully → weight = 10, value = 60
* Take B fully → weight = 30, value = 160
* Remaining capacity = 20
* Take 20/30 of C → value = 80

#### ✅ Final Value = **240.00**


## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric  | Value        |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Sorting | `O(n log n)` |
| Loop    | `O(n)`       |
| Space   | `O(1)` extra |


## 🧠 Why Greedy Works Here (But Not in 0/1 Knapsack)

| Problem             | Greedy Works? |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| Fractional Knapsack | ✅ Yes         |
| 0/1 Knapsack        | ❌ No          |

Because:

* Fractions allow **local optimal choice** to extend globally.
* In 0/1 knapsack, choosing a high ratio item may block better combinations.

## 🙋 FAQs

### ❓ Why sort by value/weight ratio?

Because it maximizes value gained per unit capacity.


### ❓ Why break after taking a fraction?

Knapsack becomes full — no more capacity.


### ❓ Can weights or values be zero?

Weight must be non-zero (division). Value can be zero.


### ❓ Is floating-point precision an issue?

Using `double` is acceptable; printing with fixed precision avoids display issues.
