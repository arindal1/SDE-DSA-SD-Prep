# 📦 Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in an Array #[1877](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-01-24)

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of **even length**.

👉 You must:

* Pair up all elements (each element used exactly once)
* Find the **maximum pair sum** among all pairs
* **Minimize** this maximum pair sum

Return the minimized maximum pair sum.



## 🧠 Why this problem matters

This problem tests:

* Greedy thinking
* Sorting intuition
* Two-pointer technique
* Understanding of **balancing extremes**

Think of it as:

> “How do I form pairs so that no single pair becomes *too powerful*?” ⚖️😄



## 👀 Example

### Input

```
nums = [3,5,2,3]
```

### Optimal Pairing

```
(2,5) → 7
(3,3) → 6
```

### Maximum Pair Sum

```
max(7, 6) = 7
```

✅ Output: `7`



## 🧩 Core Intuition (THIS is the key 🔑)

To minimize the **maximum** pair sum:

* Pair the **smallest** number with the **largest**
* Pair the second smallest with the second largest
* And so on…

Why?

* Large numbers are the most dangerous 🚨
* You neutralize them by pairing with small numbers

This is a **classic greedy balancing strategy**.



# 🐌 Brute Force Approach (What NOT to do)

### ❌ Naive Idea

* Try all possible pairings
* Compute maximum pair sum for each
* Pick the minimum among them

❌ Factorial complexity
❌ Impossible for large inputs
❌ Interview nightmare 😬



# ✅ Optimal Approach (Greedy + Sorting)

### 🔥 Strategy

1. Sort the array
2. Use two pointers:

   * `l` at start
   * `r` at end
3. Pair `nums[l] + nums[r]`
4. Track the maximum of these sums



## ✅ Given Code (Your Implementation)

### 💻 Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPairSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;

        int maxSum = 0;
        while (l < r) {
            int sum = nums[l] + nums[r];
            maxSum = max(sum, maxSum);
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```




## 🧠 Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

### 💡 Steps

```
Sort the array
Initialize l = 0, r = n-1
maxSum = 0

While l < r:
    pairSum = nums[l] + nums[r]
    maxSum = max(maxSum, pairSum)
    l++
    r--

Return maxSum
```



## 🔑 Why this works (Proof intuition)

* If the largest number is paired with anything other than the smallest,
  the pair sum only gets larger.
* Greedy pairing keeps all pair sums as balanced as possible.

This is a **minimax problem**, and greedy is optimal here 🧠✨



## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

| Metric           | Value                          |
| - | - |
| Time Complexity  | **O(N log N)**                 |
| Space Complexity | **O(1)** (ignoring sort stack) |



## 🧪 Test Cases

| nums         | Output            |
| - | -- |
| [3,5,2,3]    | 7                 |
| [1,2,3,4]    | 5                 |
| [1,1,1,1]    | 2                 |
| [100,1,50,2] | 102               |
| Large values | Correctly handled |



## 🧠 Key Observations

* Array length is always even
* Every element must be paired
* Sorting is essential
* This is a greedy minimax pattern

# ❓ FAQs

### Q1: Why not pair largest with largest?

That creates a huge maximum sum ❌



### Q2: Does pairing smallest with smallest work?

No — large numbers would still form large sums later.



### Q3: Is sorting mandatory?

Yes ✔️
Without sorting, greedy pairing fails.



### Q4: Can this be done without sorting?

Only with extra constraints.
In general, sorting is required.



### Q5: Is this a two-pointer problem?

Absolutely ✔️
One of the cleanest examples.
