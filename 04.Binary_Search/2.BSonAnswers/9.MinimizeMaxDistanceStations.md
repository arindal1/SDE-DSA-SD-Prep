# ⛽ Problem: Minimize Maximum Distance to Gas Station

---

## 📄 Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of `n` **sorted** integer positions of existing gas stations along a one‑dimensional road, you want to add **k** new gas stations such that the **maximum distance** between any two **adjacent** stations (old or new) is **minimized**. Return that minimum possible maximum distance.

* **Input:**

  * Integer `n` — number of existing stations
  * Sorted vector `arr` of length `n`, where `arr[i]` is the position of the i‑th station
  * Integer `k` — number of additional stations you may build
* **Output:**

  * A floating‑point number: the smallest possible value of

    $$
      \max_{0 \le i < n + k - 1}\bigl(\text{distance between consecutive stations}\bigr).
    $$

---

## 💡 Intuition

* If you fix a candidate maximum distance `D`, you can **greedily** decide how many new stations you must build on each interval to ensure no gap exceeds `D`:

  1. For each adjacent pair `arr[i-1]` to `arr[i]`, the gap is `gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]`.
  2. You need

     $$
       \bigl\lceil \frac{\text{gap}}{D} \bigr\rceil - 1
     $$

     new stations to break the gap into sub‑segments of length ≤ `D`.
  3. Sum these required stations; if it exceeds `k`, `D` is **too small**.
* As `D` **increases**, the required number of new stations **non-increases** (monotonic).
* We can therefore **binary search** on `D` over a real interval `[0 … maxGap]` and stop when the precision is within `1e-6`.

## 🐢 Brute‑Force Approach

Try a sequence of candidate `D` values from the maximum initial gap down to 0 in small decrements (e.g. `0.1`), recomputing needed stations each time until you find the first feasible:

```cpp
double minimiseMaxDistanceBrute(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    // find maximum initial gap
    double maxGap = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        maxGap = max(maxGap, double(arr[i] - arr[i-1]));

    // decrement by 0.1 until feasible
    for (double D = maxGap; D >= 0; D -= 0.1) {
        int required = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            required += int(ceil((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) / D)) - 1;
            if (required > k) break;
        }
        if (required <= k)
            return D;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** roughly *O((maxGap/0.1)·n)*
* **Space Complexity:** *O(1)*

> ❌ Too slow and imprecise.

## 🚀 Optimal Approach: Binary Search on Real Answer

1. **Compute bounds**:

   ```cpp
   double low  = 0.0;
   double high = max_{i}(arr[i] - arr[i-1]);
   ```
2. **Predicate** `requiredStations(D)`:

   ```cpp
   int required = 0;
   for (i = 1…n-1)
     required += (int)((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) / D);
   return required;
   ```

   This works because

   $$
     \Bigl\lceil\frac{gap}{D}\Bigr\rceil - 1
     = \bigl\lfloor\frac{gap}{D}\bigr\rfloor.
   $$
3. **Binary search** loop until `high - low ≤ 1e-6`:

   ```cpp
   while (high - low > 1e-6) {
     double mid = (low + high) / 2;
     if (requiredStations(mid) > k)
       low  = mid;  // need more stations → increase D
     else
       high = mid;  // feasible → try smaller D
   }
   return high;
   ```

This yields **O(n log ( maxGap/ε ))**, where ε = 1e-6.

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        high = max(high, double(arr[i] - arr[i-1]));

    const double eps = 1e-6;

        if (numberOfGasStationsRequired(arr, mid) > k)
            low = mid;   // too many needed → D too small
        else
            high = mid;  // feasible → try smaller D
    }
    return high;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        cin >> arr[i];

    double result = minimiseMaxDistance(arr, k);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(6) << result << "\n";
    return 0;

## 🛠️ Alternative Approach: Max‑Heap (Priority Queue)

Besides binary searching on the answer, you can also solve the gas‑station problem by **always splitting** the largest current interval. Each time you add a station, you reduce the worst gap, and you repeat this **k** times. At the end, the largest remaining gap is your answer.

### Idea

1. **Initialize** a max‑heap of all initial gaps between consecutive stations:

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
     long double gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1];
     // we store (current worst piece after s splits, original gap, splits so far)
     pq.push({gap, gap, 1});
   }
   ```
2. **Repeat** `k` times:

   * Pop the entry with the **largest** current worst‑piece length: say `(currLen, origGap, splits)`.
   * Increment `splits` by 1 → we’re placing one more station in this interval.
   * Compute the **new** worst‑piece length as

     $$
       \text{newLen} = \frac{\text{origGap}}{\text{splits}+1}\quad\text{(using long double division).}
     $$
   * Push `(newLen, origGap, splits+1)` back into the heap.
3. After **k** splits, the **top** of the heap holds the interval with the maximum segment length; that is the minimized maximum distance.

### Code Sketch

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Each heap entry: (current worst piece length, original gap, splits made)
struct Interval {
    long double currLen;
    long double origGap;
    int splits;
    bool operator<(Interval const &o) const {
        // max-heap by currLen
        return currLen < o.currLen;
    }
};

long double minimiseMaxDistanceHeap(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    priority_queue<Interval> pq;

    // Build initial gaps
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        long double gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1];
        pq.push({gap, gap, 1});
    }

    // Place k new stations greedily into the largest current gap
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        auto top = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        // We are splitting this origGap into (splits+1)+1 parts now
        int newSplits = top.splits + 1;
        long double newLen = top.origGap / (newSplits + 1);
        pq.push({newLen, top.origGap, newSplits});
    }

    // After k splits, the worst gap is at the top
    return pq.top().currLen;
}
```

### Complexity

* **Heap size:** *O(n)* initial gaps
* **Each split:** pop + push → *O(log n)*
* **Total:** *O((n + k) log n)*

This approach is often faster when *k* is relatively small (say, up to 10⁵) and avoids the repeated linear scans of the binary‐search predicate, trading them for logarithmic heap operations.

## 🎯 Tips & Tricks

* To avoid **floating‑point ceiling**, note
  $\bigl\lceil gap/D \bigr\rceil - 1 = \lfloor gap / D\rfloor.$
* Always sort the input positions before splitting intervals.
* Use a small `eps` (\~1e‑6) to stop binary search on reals.

## 🔄 Variations

1. **Minimize maximum waiting time** at bus stops (same principle).
2. **Distribute k new servers** on a line to minimize latency (continuous binary search).
3. **Maximize minimum signal strength** by placing k boosters.

## ❓ FAQs

> **Q1. Why use `high` = max gap?** <br>
> Without new stations, that is the largest distance; adding stations can only reduce it.

> **Q2. How do we decide `eps`?** <br>
> `1e-6` ensures **six‑digit** precision; adjust based on required accuracy.

> **Q3. Why return `high` instead of `low`?** <br>
> After the loop, `high` is the smallest feasible value.

> **Q4. Can `k = 0`?** <br>
> Yes—then answer is just the original maximum gap.
