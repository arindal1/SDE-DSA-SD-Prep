# 🔗 Merge Overlapping Intervals

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given a collection of intervals **`arr`**, where each interval is a pair `[start, end]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return the resulting list of **non‑overlapping** intervals sorted by start time.

> **Example:**
> Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
> Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
> Explanation: Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap and merge into `[1,6]`.

## 🐢 Brute‑Force Merging (O(n²) or worse)

### 1️⃣ Idea

1. **Initialize** a list `ans` equal to the input `arr`.
2. **Repeat** until no changes happen in a full pass:

   * **Scan** all pairs of intervals `(i, j)` in `ans`.
   * **If** `ans[i]` and `ans[j]` **overlap** (i.e. `start_i ≤ end_j && start_j ≤ end_i`),

     * **Merge** them into `[min(start_i,start_j), max(end_i,end_j)]`.
     * **Replace** `ans[i]` with the merged interval,
     * **Remove** `ans[j]`,
     * **Restart** scanning from the beginning (to avoid missing new overlaps).
3. At the end, `ans` contains only non‑overlapping intervals.

### 2️⃣ Overlap Check & Merge

```cpp
// returns true if intervals a and b overlap
bool overlaps(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a[0] <= b[1] && b[0] <= a[1];
}

// merges a and b (assumes they overlap)
vector<int> mergeTwo(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return { min(a[0], b[0]), max(a[1], b[1]) };
}
```

### 3️⃣ Brute‑Force Implementation

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> mergeBrute(vector<vector<int>> intervals) {
    int n = intervals.size();
    bool changed = true;

    while (changed) {
        changed = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size() && !changed; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < intervals.size(); ++j) {
                if (overlaps(intervals[i], intervals[j])) {
                    // merge i and j
                    intervals[i] = mergeTwo(intervals[i], intervals[j]);
                    intervals.erase(intervals.begin() + j);
                    changed = true;
                    break;  // restart outer loops
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return intervals;
}
```

### 4️⃣ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**

  * In the worst case, each merge reduces the list size by 1, and each pass scans O(n²) pairs ⇒ O(n³).
  * Even if coded more tightly, repeated pairwise merging is at least O(n²).

* **Space Complexity:**

  * O(n) for the working copy of intervals.

---

### ⚖️ Why It’s Sub‑Optimal

* **No sorting** means you may end up comparing the same pairs many times.
* **Repeated rescans** blow up the time to cubic in the worst case.

In practice, even O(n²) implementations can be simpler than sorting, but for large `n` (≥10⁴), the **sort‑and‑merge** method at O(n log n) is far more efficient.

## ⚡ Optimal Greedy Approach (O(n log n) Time)

### 1️⃣ Sort Intervals

* Sort by **ascending start**.
* If two intervals share the same start, the secondary sort by end ensures consistency (though not strictly required for merging).

### 2️⃣ Iterate & Merge

* Maintain a result list `ans`.
* For each interval `[s,e]` in sorted order:

  * **If** `ans` is empty **or** `s > ans.back()[1]`, **no overlap** → append `[s,e]`.
  * **Else** overlap exists → update `ans.back()[1] = max(ans.back()[1], e)` to merge.

This single pass after sorting runs in **O(n)**, plus **O(n log n)** for the sort.

## 📝 Pseudocode

```text
FUNCTION mergeIntervals(arr):
    IF arr is empty:
        RETURN empty list

    sort arr by interval.start ascending

    ans ← empty list
    FOR each interval [s,e] IN arr:
        IF ans is empty OR s > ans.back()[1]:
            ans.append([s,e])
        ELSE:
            // merge with previous
            ans.back()[1] = max(ans.back()[1], e)

    RETURN ans
```

## 💻 Complete C++ Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Merges overlapping intervals in 'arr' of length n.
 * Returns a vector of non-overlapping, merged intervals.
 */
vector<vector<int>> overlappingIntervals(vector<vector<int>> arr, int n) {
    if (n == 0) return {};

    // 1) Sort by start time
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    ans.reserve(n);

    // 2) Merge
    for (const auto& interval : arr) {
        if (ans.empty() || interval[0] > ans.back()[1]) {
            // No overlap: add new interval
            ans.push_back(interval);
        } else {
            // Overlap: extend the end if needed
            ans.back()[1] = max(ans.back()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<vector<int>> arr(n, vector<int>(2));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i][0] >> arr[i][1];
    }

    auto merged = overlappingIntervals(arr, n);
    for (auto& interval : merged) {
        cout << interval[0] << " " << interval[1] << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Metric               | Value         |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Time Complexity**  | O(n log n)    |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) (result) |

* Sorting dominates at O(n log n).
* Single linear pass to merge.

---

## 🚧 Edge Cases

* **Empty input** (`n = 0`) → return empty result.
* **Single interval** (`n = 1`) → returned unchanged.
* **Non‑overlapping intervals** → all are appended as‑is.
* **Fully overlapping** (nested) intervals → completely merged into one.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What if intervals are unsorted or given in random order?**

> Sorting by start time is essential. Without sorting, a single pass merge is incorrect.

---

**Q2: Can we merge in-place?**

> Yes—overwrite the input vector by building the merged list into its front portion, then resize.

---

**Q3: How to handle open intervals or floats?**

> Same logic applies—compare floating starts/ends, just be cautious about precision when checking overlap.
